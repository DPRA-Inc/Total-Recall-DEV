                        <p>ShopAware.gov’s mission is to provide timely information to educate and therefore inform the user on the safety of the products they and their family are consuming to empower them to make wise choices. </p>

                        <p class="font-bold">Vision</p>

                        <p>In a world that is becoming increasing global, it is more important than ever for the individual to have information about products they consume; products that could be sourced in areas thousands of miles from their local market. Bringing the information to the user is a key component of the ShopAware.gov vision. Our users are parents, siblings, grandparents, and friends that care about the items they put in their shopping cart. No longer will an individual have to search for information through various government websites. ShopAware.gov brings them awareness by providing the information in a single place. We continue to build strong public/private partnerships to meet our vision of protecting your health through information!</p>
