HEALTH PROFESSIONALS REPORT: A (B)(6) MALE PATIENT WITH MEDICAL HISTORY OF STROKE, APPENDECTOMY AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) AND ABLATION OF ONE MICRO POLYP DURING COLONOSCOPY IN (B)(6) 2014, BUT WITHOUT HISTORY OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE, UNDERWENT A CT VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH PROTOCO21 FOR COLON INSUFFLATION SET FOLEY CATHETER (REF. 6450, LOT NUMBER UNK) ON (B)(6) 2014 DUE TO INCOMPLETE VISUALIZATION OF THE RIGHT ANGLE OF COLON DURING THE COLONOSCOPY IN (B)(6) 2014.

DURING THE PROCEDURE THE BALLOON EXPLODED WHILE THE PATIENT CHANGED FROM DORSAL TO LATERAL POSITION. THE PATIENT HAD NOTICED A CHANGE AND THE IMAGING TEAM REALIZED THAT THE BALLOON HAD EXPLODED. THE PROCEDURE WAS STOPPED, BUT COULD BE RESTARTED AND FINALIZED WITHOUT PROBLEM ON THE SAME DAY WITH ANOTHER BALLOON ADMINISTRATION SET FOLEY CATHETER. NO MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES AT ALL OCCURRED FOR THE PATIENT. OUTCOME: UNK. THIS CASE IS MEDICALLY CLOSED.

THE PATIENT HAD NO HISTORY OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASE. HOWEVER, DURING THE COLONOSCOPY PERFORMED 3 MONTHS AGO, ONE MICRO POLYP WAS REMOVED. OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDED APPENDECTOMY AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) AND STROKE. DURING THE PROCEDURE, WHILE CHANGING POSITION, THE PATIENT NOTICED A CHANGE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE IMAGING TEAM NOTED THAT THE BALLOON HAD EXPLODED. THERE WAS NO CLINICAL CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PATIENT DUE TO THE EVENT AND THE PROCEDURE COULD BE COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER BALLOON ON THE SAME DAY. TO PERFORM CT COLONOSCOPY THIN CATHETER WITH SMALL BALLOON IS GENERALLY USED. EXPLOSION OF THE BALLOON MIGHT OCCUR AND THIS COULD BE THE RESULT OF A BALLOON OVER-DISTENTION OR OF A VARIATION OF THE RESULTANT FORCE BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE BALLOON. IN THIS CASE, THE BALLOON INFLATION HAD BEEN TESTED BEFORE ITS INSERTION INTO THE RECTUM. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF AIR USED TO INFLATE THE BALLOON WAS 50 ML (35 ML PLUS 15 ML). THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE PROCEDURE SINCE THE BALLOON EXPLOSION OCCURRED WHEN THE PATIENT CHANGE POSITION (E.G. FROM DORSAL DECUBITUS TO LATERAL DECUBITUS). IN FACT, DURING THE CT COLONOSCOPY, WHEN THE PATIENT CHANGE THE POSITION FROM SUPINE TO PRONE A HIGHER PRESSURE UP TO 40-50 MMHG COULD BE GENERATED INTO THE COLON INSTEAD OF THE OPTIMAL ONE OF 25 MMHG. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, A VARIATION OF THE RESULTANT FORCE BETWEEN THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE BALLOON COULD OCCUR AND DETERMINE AND EXPLOSION/DEFLATION OF THE BALLOON. BASED ON THE ABOVE, EVEN THOUGH THE EVENT IS CONSIDERED NOT MANUFACTURING RELATED BUT PROCEDURAL RELATED, THE MANUFACTURER HAS DECIDED TO HAVE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND TO REPORT THIS CASE.",
